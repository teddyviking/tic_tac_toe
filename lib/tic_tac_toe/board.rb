#Board#default_grid is a private method as it is only meant to be called by instances 
#of the Board class. It is important to limit public interfaces early in a project, 
#especially for methods that are only intended to respond to messages from self.


# Since we defined grid to be an attr_reader, Ruby has automatically wrapped an instance 
# method around the @grid instance variable, so we donâ€™t need to reference the @grid instance 
# variable directly. Whenever possible, it is preferable to reference instance methods over 
# instance variables as instance methods are less likely to be changes in arbitrary ways 
# that may be difficult to track.
